				<h3>
					MyDashWallet is not a Bank
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>  When you open an account with a bank or exchange, they create an account for you in their system.  </li>
					<li>  The bank keeps track of your personal information, account passwords, balances, transactions and ultimately your money.  </li>
					<li>  The bank charge fees to manage your account and provide services, like refunding transactions when your card gets stolen.  </li>
					<li>  The bank allows you to write a check or charge your debit card to send money, go online to check your balance, reset your password, and get a new debit card if you lose it.  </li>
					<li>  You have an account with the bank or exchange and they decide how much money you can send, where you can send it, and how long to hold on a suspicious deposit. All for a fee.  </li>
				</ul>

				<h3>
					MyDashWallet is an Interface
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>  When you create an account on MyDashWallet you are generating a cryptographic set of numbers: your private key and your public key (address).  </li>
					<li>  The handling of your keys happens entirely on your computer, inside your browser.  </li>
					<li>  We never transmit, receive or store your private key, password, or other account information.  </li>
					<li>  We do not charge a transaction fee.  </li>
					<li>  You are simply using our interface to interact directly with the blockchain.  </li>
					<li>  If you send your public key (address) to someone, they can send you DASH. 👍  </li>
					<li>  If you send your private key to someone, they now have full control of your account. 👎  </li>

				<h3>
					Wait, WTF is a Blockchain?
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>  The blockchain is like a huge, global, decentralized spreadsheet.  </li>
					<li>  It keeps track of who sent how many coins to whom, and what the balance of every account is.  </li>
					<li>  It is stored and maintained by thousands of people (miners) across the globe who have special computers.  </li>
					<li>  The blocks in the blockchain are made up of all the individual transactions sent from MyDashWallet and everywhere else.  </li>
					<li>  When you see your balance on MyDashWallet.org or view your transactions on <a href="//explorer.dash.org">explorer.dash.org</a>, you are seeing data on the blockchain, not in our personal systems.  </li>
					<li>  Again: we are not a bank  </li>

				<ul>
					<li>  Access your account or send your funds for you X.  </li>
					<li>  Recover or change your private key.  </li>
					<li>  Recover or reset your password.  </li>

					<li>  If lose your private key or password, no one can recover it.  </li>

				<h3>
					If MyDashWallet can't do those things, what's the point?
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>  Because that is the point of decentralization and the blockchain.  </li>
					<li>  You don't have to rely on your bank, government, or anyone else when you want to move your funds.  </li>
					<li>  You don't have to rely on the security of an exchange or bank to keep your funds safe.  </li>
					<li>  If you don't find these things valuable, ask yourself why you think the blockchain and cryptocurrencies are valuable. 😉  </li>
					<li>  If you don't like the sound of this, consider using <a href="https://uphold.com/">Uphold</a>, <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a> or any online exchange or service supporting Dash. They have more familiar accounts with usernames &amp; passwords.  </li>
					<li>  If you are scared but want to use MyDashWallet, <a href="/AboutHardwareWallets">get a hardware wallet</a>! These keep your keys secure.  </li>

					How To Protect Yourself from Phishers
				</h3>
				Phishers send you a message with a link to a website that looks just like MyDashWallet, Paypal, or your bank, but is not the real website. They steal your information and then steal your money.
				<ul>
					<li>  Always check the URL: <code>https://MyDashWallet.org</code>.  </li>
					<li>  Always make sure the <code>MyDashWallet.org</code> URL bar has <b>Secure</b> in green.  </li>
					<li>  Do not trust messages or links sent to you randomly via email, Slack, Reddit, Twitter, etc.  </li>
					<li>  Always navigate directly to a site before you enter information. Do not enter information after clicking a link from a message or email.  </li>
					<li>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">Install an AdBlocker</a> and do not click ads on your search engine (e.g. Google).  </li>

					How To Protect Yourself from Scams
				</h3>
				People will try to get you to give them money in return for nothing.
				<ul>
					<li>  If it is too good to be true, it probably is.  </li>
					<li>  Research before sending money to someone or some project. Look for information on a variety of websites and forums. Be wary.  </li>
					<li>  Ask questions when you don't understand something or it doesn't seem right.  </li>
					<li>  Don't let fear, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt">FUD</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">FOMO</a> win over common sense. If something is very urgent, ask yourself "why?". It may be to create FOMO or prevent you from doing research.  </li>

				<h3>
					How To Protect Yourself from Loss
				</h3>
				If you lose your private key or password, it is gone forever. Don't lose it.
				<ul>
					<li>  Make a backup of your private key and password. Do NOT just store it on your computer. Print it out on a piece of paper or save it to a USB drive.  </li>
					<li>  Store this paper or USB drive in a different physical location. A backup is not useful if it is destroyed by a fire or flood along with your laptop.  </li>
					<li>  Do not store your private key in Dropbox, Google Drive, or other cloud storage. If that account is compromised, your funds will be stolen.  </li>
					<li>  If you have more than 1-week's worth of pay worth of cryptocurrency, get a hardware wallet. No excuses. It's worth it. I promise.  </li>
