			The TREZOR is the original cryptocurrency hardware wallet, it is easy to use and besides the Ledger the most used one, it is available for purchase <a href="https://trezor.io/?a=mydashwallet.org">here</a>. It supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, you can also check other guides (like <a href="https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/migration/moving-from-private-key-to-trezor-hardware-wallet.html">this excellent one for Ethereum and its tokens using MyEtherWallet</a>, this guide is based on it).<br /><br />

			<p>The TREZOR has two buttons that are used to confirm/deny actions. To start the set-up of your TREZOR, go to the URL displayed.</p>
			<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nFt5R6p.jpg"></p>
			<p>Please read all the information on this page. It gives you a bunch of information and instructions on how the TREZOR works, you will need this information in the next steps.</p>
			<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9XgRqKi.jpg"></p>
			<p>Once you've read all the information on this page <strong>thoroughly</strong>, you can continue.</p>
			<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WKuHHe3.jpg"></p>
			<p>After clicking the green "Done, let's go!" button, you will be redirected to wallet.trezor.io. This is where you will be setting up your TREZOR. Enter a name for your TREZOR, and click Continue.</p>
			<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CJERk10.jpg" style="width: 50%; height: 50%"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/A6zBzI3.jpg" style="display:inline-block width: 30%; height: 30%"></center>

			<p>You will now have to enter a new PIN that you will use to access your TREZOR any time you want to access your wallets. Make sure this is a hard to guess pin, so that others won't be able to get access to your TREZOR. If you are not sure how PINs work with the TREZOR, look <a href="http://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-user/enteringyourpin.html">here</a> for more information.</p>
			<p>
				<em>
					Example:
					I want to set "8963" as pin. This would mean that I have to click the lower-left button, then the middle-right button, then the lower-middle button, and finally the upper-left button.
				</em>
			</p>

			<p>Now re-enter your PIN you just created. Be aware that the order of the numbers on your TREZOR has changed, so you will have to click different buttons in order to enter the correct PIN.</p>
			<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DnPRxNY.jpg" style="width: 50%; height: 50%"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/27wfOOI.jpg" style="display:inline-block width: 30%; height: 30%"></center>

			<p>Next, the TREZOR will give you 24 random words that you will have to write down on the provided card in the box. These are the recovery words, also known as seed, that you will have to use when you want to restore your TREZOR in case it fails or you accidentally reset the TREZOR. Once you've written down all of the words it will ask you to confirm your recovery phrase, in order to make sure that you've written them down correctly.</p>
			<p><strong>Do not save these recovery words on your computer, as it will be just as unsafe as using a normal private key. Always write them down physically using a pen, on a piece of paper only you have access to. Also do not take a photo of your piece of paper.</strong></p>

			<p>Now your TREZOR is all set-up and ready to be used!</p>
